Analysis of the woman clothing product
The purpose of this research is to predict price of woman clothing product. Further I will be exploring the products by performing exploratory data analysis segmentation. This study uses information about different woman clothing data from Etsy.com.
	Today’s woman clothing is a line of ultimate representation of a woman body confidence that will make her all the more stylish and glamorous. 
	I scraped seven woman clothing category with 3360 entries data from Etsy web site.
Attributes Information:
1)	Item - Name of the Product 
2)	Category - Product category like, Dresses, top and tees, skirts, jackets and coats, pants and carries etc.

After that I will clean data according to my questions for example I will converting long product names into small key words, promo section I will change 1 for free shipping and 0 for fee shipping etc. Next step will be exploratory data analysis where we will analyses the data sets summarize their main characteristics, mostly using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. 
I will use ols regression for woman clothing price prediction.

For segmentation of woman clothing product I will be using k-means clustering. k-means clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning that uses data that is not assign to a specific category or groups called unlabeled data. k-means clustering finds the most significant cluster and then determines the grouping of cluster based on the distance between the data points according to inputted attributes.
